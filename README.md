# Credit_Score_Prediction

## 📌 Overview
Credit Score Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting an individual's credit score based on various financial and personal attributes. This tool can help financial institutions assess creditworthiness and make informed lending decisions.

## 🚀 Features
- Predict credit score categories (e.g., Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent)
- Uses machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Interactive web application for real-time predictions (optional)
